# Home Assistant Integration for Calaos

[![Open your Home Assistant instance and open a repository inside the Home Assistant Community Store.](https://my.home-assistant.io/badges/hacs_repository.svg)](https://my.home-assistant.io/redirect/hacs_repository/?owner=tiramiseb&repository=calaos-ha&category=integration)

[Calaos](https://www.calaos.fr/) is a home automation platform, initially created with support of Wago 750 series PLCs.

This integration allows getting Calaos inputs and outputs states into Home Assistant, as well as triggering Calaos outputs.

Calaos configuration cannot be changed using Home Assistant.

## Notice

This integration is an independent project: the Calaos team is by no means invovled in its development.
